Nothing to do.

## Possible To-dos

- Change default file-filtering argument to `.*\.txt`?
  - Pro: Avoid future `.git`-trashing -- like the event, that got me desparate
    enough, to put this repository onto GitHub
  - Con: Goes against the general principle of:
    - being as general as possible
    - not having exceptions/hidden edge cases
- Exclude `.git` from directory traversal?
  - Pros and cons: See above pros and cons
