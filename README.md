# Tabs to Spaces CLI Utility

```yaml
Implementation language: Go
Build tool: go build
```

I'll be honest: I didn't expect, to make this a repository;
I just wanted a quick script, that'd do some regex on files.

Also, the irony of using a language, where tabs are enforced over spaces, to
convert tabs to spaces, is not lost on me.

## Warning

No tests have been written.
Program has never been run.
It compiles -- that's all I can guarantee.

## Usage

See the usage text in `main.go`.
