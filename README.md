# Tabs to Spaces CLI Utility

```yaml
Implementation language: Go
Build tool: go build
```

I'll be honest: I didn't expect, to make this a repository;
I just wanted [a quick script, that'd do some regex on files](tabstospaces.ps1).

Also, the irony of using a language, where tabs are enforced over spaces, to
convert tabs to spaces, is not lost on me.

## Warning

Program has never been run.
It compiles, and there are tests -- that's all I can guarantee.

## Usage

See [USAGE](USAGE).

## Licence

Something MIT-ish, I guess. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
